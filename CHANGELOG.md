# 0.5.4

## Added

- `when` condition on `set_field` patch operation — skip the operation unless a specified field equals a specified value; enables conditional field updates without separate patch passes

```yaml
- op: set_field
  target_pattern: "**/*.md"
  field: review_cycle
  value: monthly
  when:
    field: review_cycle
    equals: "1"
```

---

# 0.5.3

## Added

- **Stale note review** — fully wired into the lint engine; flags notes whose review cycle has elapsed as `warning` with rule `stale_note`
- Review cycle field now uses named enum values: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly`, `yearly`, `never` — no more ambiguous numbers; `never` is always skipped
- Day mapping: `daily` = 1, `weekly` = 7, `monthly` = 30, `quarterly` = 90, `yearly` = 365
- Notes missing the cycle field, last updated field, or with unknown cycle values are skipped silently

## Changed

- `examples/schema.md` updated — `review_cycle` enum values changed from `[1, 3, 6, 12, never]` to `[daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, never]`
- Settings description for review cycle field updated to communicate required enum values
- `4.Linting.md` updated with cycle value semantics and day mappings

---

# 0.5.2

## Changed

- Updated vault-native documentation to reflect 0.5.0 export architecture — commands, settings, and export docs revised; examples unchanged

---

# 0.5.0

## Added

- **Type field** and **Status field** settings — choose which schema field represents note type and lifecycle status in exports; defaults to `type` and `status` if left blank; field names used as JSON keys in `vault-meta.json` and as column headings in markdown notes
- **Dashboard note** — created once on first overview export run, never overwritten; contains Dataview blocks for vault overview, ontology index summary (`node_type` as first column), and optional private note breakdown; filename is configurable (default: `vault-dashboard`)
- **Dashboard name setting** — text field to set the dashboard note filename; blank defaults to `vault-dashboard`
- `total_private_notes::` inline field added to all ontology index notes; always present (0 when private notes is disabled)
- `total_notes::` and `total_private_notes::` always present in `vault-export.md`

## Changed

- `vault-overview.md` renamed to `vault-export.md`
- `node_count::` renamed to `total_notes::` in ontology index notes for consistency
- `vault-meta.json` keys now reflect configured field names (`note_counts_by_{fieldName}`) rather than hardcoded `type`/`status`/`domain`
- Ontology index node table column headings use configured domain and status field names
- Machine-readable data reference moved to top of `vault-export.md` for quicker access
- All section headings in `vault-export.md` and dashboard at `#` level — no H1s in either note
- Overview options settings descriptions rewritten to be more user-friendly

---

# 0.4.11

## Added

- **Domain field setting** — choose which frontmatter field represents a note's domain in overview and meta exports; falls back to parent folder if left blank
- **Private notes setting** — optional toggle + field selector to identify private notes; any truthy value in the chosen field marks the note as private; when enabled, `vault-meta.json` excludes private notes from its counts and `vault-export.md` adds a separate private notes section (by domain, type, status)
- `total_notes::` and `total_private_notes::` inline fields in `vault-export.md`; `total_private_notes::` is always 0 when private notes is disabled
- **Exclude folders** — multi-select persisted list of folders to skip during ontology export; applies at any depth

## Changed

- Private note sections in `vault-export.md` only appear when private notes is enabled and count > 0
- No H1 headings in export notes; all section headings at `#` level
- Overview now includes notes by status in the all-notes block (previously only domain and type)

---

# 0.4.10

## Changed

- `Export Vault Inventory` and `Export Vault Meta` merged into a single `Export Vault Overview` command — produces `vault-inventory.json`, `vault-meta.json`, and `vault-export.md` in one pass
- All timestamps changed from UTC ISO format to local machine time with no timezone suffix — Obsidian renders timestamps as local time so UTC offsets were displaying incorrectly
- `localTimestamp()` helper added to `utils/files.ts`; used across all commands that write user-visible timestamps
- `safeTimestamp()` and `todayString()` updated to use local time

## Removed

- `export-inventory.ts` and `export-meta.ts` consolidated into `export-overview.ts`
- Separate `vault-inventory.md` and `vault-meta.md` notes replaced by single `vault-export.md`

---

# 0.4.9

## Fixed

- Multi-select component CSS now scoped inside the settings container — previously injected into `document.head` where Obsidian's modal didn't pick it up, causing unstyled rendering
- Stale note review in-scope filter now uses the same field→values pattern as the export filter — user picks any schema field, then selects enum values from it; removes hardcoded dependency on a `status` field

## Added

- `staleReviewFilterField` setting — which schema field determines in-scope notes for stale review (defaults to `status` for existing users)

---

# 0.4.8

## Changed

- Multi-select controls (stale review statuses, export filter values) replaced with dropdown + chip component — scales cleanly to any number of values, avoids Obsidian CSS override issues with checkbox inputs

---

# 0.4.7

## Added

- **Export module** — three new commands and a dedicated Export tab in settings
  - `Export Vault Inventory` — builds a flat structural index of all non-exempt vault notes; schema is optional
  - `Export Vault Meta` — exports aggregate counts by domain, status, and type; honors `ai_private: true`
  - `Export Ontology Index` — builds per-type relationship graphs from a user-configured heading; auto-runs inventory if none exists on disk
- All exports produce both a machine-readable JSON file and a human-readable Obsidian markdown note with frontmatter and summary tables
- **Settings tabs** — settings pane is now tabbed: General | Lint | Patch | Maintenance | Export | Shapes
- **Export tab** — enabled toggle, exports folder picker, reload from schema, dynamic field + value filter (schema-driven, no hardcoded types), relationship heading input, and run buttons for all three exports
- **Stale Note Review** — new feature under the Lint tab (enabled toggle); configures which frontmatter field holds the review cycle, which holds the last-updated date, and which statuses are in scope for stale flagging
- **Lint Reports folder** — lint run notes now write to a dedicated configurable folder (default `System/Exports/LintReports`) separate from the main exports folder
- **Patch backup folder** — backup destination is now configurable in the Patch tab; `vault-paths.ts` and `apply-patch.ts` both honour the setting
- **Shapes tab** — placeholder tab with enabled toggle; reserved for Vault Shape Engine

## Changed

- Schema note picker moved from General to Lint tab (lint is its primary consumer)
- Exports folder moved from General/System Paths to Export tab
- Shapes folder moved from General/System Paths to Shapes tab
- All folder pickers now show folder-tree only — no files listed
- `patchBackups` path in `vault-paths.ts` now resolves from `patchBackupFolder` setting with fallback to `patchesFolder/Backups`

## Removed

- Inbox retention slider removed from settings UI (inbox retention logic preserved in maintenance for compatibility; stale note reporting planned for a future release)

---
