# 1.5.1

## Added

- Maintenance cleanup for Shape Lint run notes.
- Maintenance cleanup for Shape Repair history and run notes.
- Maintenance setting for Shape Lint run retention.

## Changed

- Shape Repair maintenance now enforces retention even when no new repair run has been appended.

## Compatibility

- Shape Lint still keeps the latest `shape-lint-report.json`; maintenance trims accumulated run notes.
- Existing Shape Repair retention settings are reused for both repair history and repair run notes.

---

# 1.5.0

## Added

- Vault Health dashboard auto-refresh control.
- Auto-refresh interval options for 1, 3, 5, 15, and 30 minutes.
- Persistent dashboard auto-refresh settings.

## Changed

- Scheduled dashboard refreshes use the existing background refresh service silently, without success or failure notices.
- Manual dashboard refresh behavior remains unchanged.

## Compatibility

- Auto-refresh is disabled by default.
- Existing dashboard cache and command workflows are preserved.
- No user migration is required.

---

# 1.4.0

## Added

- Forge Health dashboard now preloads into the right sidebar as a side-panel tab.
- Dashboard Settings button for direct access to Forge settings.
- Dashboard actions for maintenance, normalization, repair, ontology refresh, snapshot export, template refinement, patch history, and last-run review.
- Operational history tracking for maintenance, normalization, template refinement, and shape repair.
- Shared preview type contract for future preview/apply workflows.
- Dry-run support in template refinement for future preview workflows.

## Changed

- Dashboard action layout now uses a responsive grid for better desktop, side-pane, and mobile behavior.
- Patch history can now surface recent repair and normalization activity when available.
- Dashboard cache schema was bumped with graceful fallback for existing cache files.

## Compatibility

- Existing command palette workflows and command IDs remain supported.
- Existing patch, restore, lint, schema, export, repair, and normalization behavior is preserved.
- The preview/apply foundation is present, but the full selected-apply modal workflow is not exposed in this release.

# 1.3.3

## Fixed

- Vault Health Dashboard relationship type counts now come from `schema.md` `ontology.relationships` instead of exported ontology records.

---

# 1.3.2

## Changed

- Refined Vault Health Dashboard responsive layout for narrow and wide Obsidian panes.
- Restored compact metric card wrapping on mobile and small dashboard widths.

---

# 1.3.1

## Changed

- Refined Vault Health Dashboard responsive layout for freely resized Obsidian panes.
- Dashboard cards, section badges, issue groups, and maintenance history rows now wrap more safely at narrow widths.

---

# 1.3.0

## Added

- Dedicated Shape Lint service and `Forge: Run Shape Lint` command.
- Separate Shape Lint exports at `System/Exports/shape-lint-report.json` and `System/Exports/ShapeLintReports/`.
- Vault Health Dashboard Shape Health section with structural issue counts and issue rows.
- Dashboard cache support for `latest_shape_lint_result`.

## Changed

- Vault Lint and Shape Lint are now separate workflows. Active Issues reports general Vault Lint findings, while Shape Health reports shape/template heading issues.
- Dashboard refresh runs Shape Lint only when Shape lint is enabled.

---

# 1.2.0

## Added

- Operation-level Patch Restore for new patch manifests. Forge now records changed patch operations with target, before value, after value, and reverse action data.
- Selective restore workflow for patch runs with operation manifests, including per-operation status, conflict detection, and checkbox selection.
- Patch restore reports for operation-level restores.

## Changed

- Patch manifests now write `manifest_version: 2` and preserve legacy `changes` backup entries while adding an `operations` array.
- New patch applies no longer create full-file `.bak` backups for operation-manifest restore.
- Restore Patch Run keeps legacy full-file restore fallback for old manifests, but labels it clearly as full-file backup restore.
- Patch history can surface changed operation counts from v2 manifests.

## Safety

- Operation-level restore only reverses an operation when the current value still matches the value written by the original patch.
- Conflicted operations are skipped by default to preserve unrelated edits made after patch apply.

---

# 1.1.0

## Added

- Vault Health Dashboard custom Obsidian view with manual refresh, cached results, summary metrics, schema health, active lint issue listing, ontology metrics, maintenance history, and section-level health indicators.
- Dashboard service/cache layer backed by `System/Forge/health-dashboard.json`.
- Reusable lint, schema, ontology, patch-history, and dashboard composition services for dashboard consumption and future workflow orchestration.
- Commands: Open Vault Health Dashboard and Refresh Vault Health Dashboard.
- In-dashboard actions for Run Vault Lint, Validate Schema, and Open schema.md.

## Changed

- Vault Lint, Validate Schema, Export Ontology Index, and Apply Vault Patch now update dashboard-visible service cache state as part of their normal command flow.
- Open dashboard views now refresh from the latest cached state after supported Forge commands complete.

---

# 1.0.0

## Breaking Changes

Schema structure has changed completely in this release. Existing `schema.md` files using the previous contract will not be read by Forge. Migration is required before upgrading.

See the Schema Reference documentation for the complete 1.0.0 contract structure.

### Schema contract restructured

The following top-level keys have been removed:

- `required_fields`
- `optional_fields`
- `inline_fields`
- `meta`

The following top-level keys are now required:

- `frontmatter` — with `required` and `optional` sublists
- `inline` — with an `allowed` list
- `ontology` — with a `relationships` map
- `tag_rules`
- `exempt_paths`

### `inline_fields` replaced by `inline.allowed`

The flat `inline_fields` list is replaced by `inline.allowed`. Each entry is now an object with at minimum `name`. Entries may also carry `required_when` and `severity` for conditional validation.

### `required_fields` / `optional_fields` replaced by `frontmatter`

Field contracts now live under `frontmatter.required` and `frontmatter.optional`. The structure of each field entry is unchanged.

### `meta` block removed

The `meta` block is no longer read by Forge. Version is now read from an inline field or frontmatter field configured in Settings → Lint. The block may remain in your schema note — Forge does not validate or reject extra keys.

---

## Added

### Schema

- `inline.allowed` entries support `required_when` — conditional inline field requirements scoped to specific note types via `field` and `values` keys
- `tag_rules.forbidden_namespaces` — explicitly reserved strings that must not be used as tag namespaces; violations are always `error` severity regardless of strict mode
- `review_cycle` field supports `values_meta` — each enum value can carry a `days` count that Forge uses for stale review calculations; replaces the internal hardcoded day map
- `biweekly` (14 days) and `semiannual` (182 days) added to the recommended `review_cycle` enum values
- `ontology.relationships` is the canonical source for all relationship definitions — `description`, `direction`, `allowed_between` / `sources` / `targets`, and `template_heading` per relationship

### Settings — Lint tab

- **Version field location** — choose whether the schema version lives in inline metadata or frontmatter
- **Version field** — schema-driven dropdown populated from the chosen location; defaults to `version` inline
- **Repair prompt threshold** — choose when the Open Vault Repair button appears after lint: errors only (default) or errors and warnings

### Settings — Shapes tab

- **Inject relationship headings from schema** — when enabled, template refinement injects relationship headings into generated templates based on `ontology.relationships`
- **Relationship parent heading** — configurable parent heading name; defaults to `Related`
- **Relationship heading level** — H1, H2, or H3 for the parent heading; subheadings are always one level below; defaults to H1
- **Relationship injection position** — Append (add section at end) or Inject (add missing headings under existing parent, falls back to append)

### Lint engine

- `forbidden_namespace` — new lint rule; fires when a tag uses a namespace in `tag_rules.forbidden_namespaces`; always `error` severity
- `required_when` — inline field conditional requirement rule; fires when a frontmatter field matches a configured value and the inline field is absent
- Stale review day counts now read from `review_cycle.values_meta` in schema instead of a hardcoded internal map; adding or removing cycle values in schema automatically updates stale review behavior

### Vault Repair

- **Write & Open Patch** button — writes the repair patch and immediately opens it in the editor
- Repair now includes warning-severity results when threshold is set to errors and warnings; repairable warning rules: `required_field`, `type_mismatch`, `enum_value`, `date_format`, `required_when`, `no_frontmatter`, `tag_namespace`, `unknown_tag_namespace`, `forbidden_namespace`, `stale_date`

### Template Refinement

- Relationship headings injected from schema include the relationship `description` as body text under each subheading

### Upgrade notice

- Users upgrading from a previous installation see a one-time migration notice on first load summarising the schema contract changes; fresh installs are unaffected

---

## Changed

- Validate Schema now performs recursive structural validation — each section and subsection is checked against the expected contract shape; ontology relationship entries are only validated when `shapeLintEnabled` or `exportEnabled` is on
- Validate Schema is now settings-aware — passes active settings to structural validation so feature-gated sections are only checked when the relevant feature is enabled
- Schema cache helpers updated to use new schema structure: `getFrontmatterFieldNames`, `getEnumFieldNames`, `getEnumValues`, `getFieldType`, `getInlineFieldNames`, `getFieldNamesByLocation`
- `inline_undocumented` lint message updated to reference `inline.allowed` instead of `inline_fields`
- All field pointer settings in the settings tab render as schema-driven dropdowns rather than free-text inputs
- Export commands read `schema.version` directly rather than `schema.meta.version`

---

## Removed

- Hardcoded `CYCLE_DAYS` constant in lint engine — replaced by `review_cycle.values_meta` traversal
- `lint_output` and `patch_engine` keys removed from `VaultSchema` TypeScript interface — these were unused and not present in schema
- `SchemaMeta` interface removed
- Legacy schema key detection removed — Forge does not attempt to read or migrate the previous schema structure

---

# 0.9.0

## Added

- **Recursive documentation and examples install support** — bundled `docs/` and `examples/` content can now be organized into subfolders and installed into the matching vault structure under the configured Forge folders
- **Complete vault-installed documentation set** — added a redesigned documentation tree covering getting started, folder layout, commands, schema reference, vault lint, patch engine, docs installer, maintenance, settings, troubleshooting, exports, ontology indexes, normalization, vault repair, Shapes, Shape lint, Shape repair, and Shape versioning roadmap guidance
- **Complete examples structure** — added organized example packs for starter schemas, lint cleanup, patch workflows, repair workflows, exports, Shapes, and maintenance routines
- **Screenshot asset set** — added a canonical documentation/wiki screenshot set under `assets/screenshots/` with stable raw GitHub embed filenames
- **Relationship index documentation** — expanded ontology/export documentation with user-facing explanations of how relationship indexes help navigation, dashboards, AI workflows, Dataview, and Bases
- **Docs installer reference** — added documentation for install targets, placeholder substitution, subfolder preservation, no-overwrite behavior, and generated frontmatter handling
- **Shape workflow documentation** — added dedicated guides for Shapes overview, template refinement, Shape lint, Shape repair, and practical Shape versioning conventions

## Changed

- Reworked README positioning from infrastructure-heavy "vault governance" language toward broader vault consistency, reliability, Dataview/Bases support, and approachable long-term maintenance
- Restructured bundled docs and examples from flat files into ordered subfolders with `1.`, `2.`, etc. filename prefixes where reading order matters
- Updated docs to avoid top-level H1 title duplication where Obsidian already displays the note title; section headings now start at `#` inside those notes
- Replaced deprecated screenshot references with the finalized asset filenames
- Reframed ontology documentation as practical relationship indexes so the feature is understandable to non-specialist Obsidian users
- Updated manual installation guidance to tell users to click **Reload plugins** after install or update

## Removed

- Removed references to obsolete flat documentation files
- Removed or replaced deprecated screenshot names
