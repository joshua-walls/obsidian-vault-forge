Schema-driven vault governance for Obsidian.

Vault Forge helps you lint, validate, normalize, repair, and maintain long-lived Obsidian vaults using structured operations and repeatable workflows.

Designed for users who treat their vault like durable infrastructure.

Vault Forge treats vault maintenance as an explicit operational workflow.

## What Vault Forge Does

Vault Forge provides operational tooling for Obsidian vault maintenance:

- Schema validation
- Vault linting
- Frontmatter normalization
- Tag normalization
- Patch operations
- Repair workflows
- Maintenance routines
- Dataview-safe folder operations
- Vault-native documentation installation

Think of it as:

> ESLint + migrations + maintenance tooling for your Obsidian vault.

## Best Fit

Vault Forge is especially useful for:

- Large or long-lived vaults
- Structured PKM systems
- PARA-style organizations
- Dataview-heavy workflows
- Research repositories
- Shared/team vaults
- Knowledge engineering workflows
- Metadata-driven note systems

# Core Concepts

## Schema Validation

Vault Forge validates notes against a configurable schema.

Schemas define:

- required metadata
- allowed values
- tag rules
- lint severity
- operational expectations

Example:

```yaml
required_fields:
  - name: status
    type: enum
    values:
      - draft
      - active
      - archived
```

Schemas provide the structural foundation for linting, repair workflows, normalization, and patch operations.

---

## Vault Linting

Linting validates notes against the configured schema.

Vault Forge can detect:

- missing frontmatter
- invalid enum values
- malformed metadata
- inconsistent tags
- schema violations
- metadata drift

Linting helps maintain long-term structural consistency across the vault.

---

## Normalization

Normalization standardizes metadata formatting.

Examples include:

- sorting tags
- deduplicating tags
- reordering frontmatter
- standardizing field values

This improves Dataview consistency and reduces structural drift over time.

---

## Vault Patches

Patches are explicit vault operations stored as markdown notes.

Vault Forge uses patches for:

- metadata repair
- tag normalization
- vault migrations
- note movement
- repeatable maintenance workflows

Example:

````md
# Patch

```yaml
operations:
  - op: set_field
    target: "Home.md"
    field: status
    value: active
```
````

Patch operations remain reviewable, auditable, and restorable.

---

# Documentation

Vault Forge installs vault-native operational documentation and examples directly into your vault.

Documentation includes:

- onboarding notes
- schema documentation
- linting workflows
- patch workflows
- troubleshooting guidance
- operational examples

Documentation intentionally lives inside the vault so it remains:

- searchable
- linkable
- syncable
- reviewable

---

# Safety Philosophy

Vault Forge is designed for long-term vault maintenance.

The plugin emphasizes:

- Predictable operations
- Structured workflows
- Explicit reviewable changes
- Repairability
- Operational visibility
- Repeatability

You remain in control of vault modifications.

Recommended practices:

- Use Git for large vaults
- Backup before major patch operations
- Test schemas incrementally
- Run linting before patching

---

## Schema Validation

Define explicit metadata contracts and validate vault structure against a canonical schema.

---

## Patch Operations

Apply reviewable vault operations with backups, reports, and restore manifests.

---

## Settings

Configure system paths, patch behavior, linting rules, backups, and maintenance retention.

# Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Release builds are generated from the plugin root and packaged as release assets.

---

# Philosophy

Knowledge systems decay over time.

Vault Forge exists to help long-lived Obsidian vaults remain:

- Structured
- Queryable
- Repairable
- Consistent
- Maintainable

Treat your vault like durable infrastructure instead of disposable notes.
